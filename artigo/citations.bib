  abstract={This paper presents FORTIS 3.0, a revolutionary transparent computing architecture that addresses the fundamental limitations of blockchain-based electoral systems. By abandoning blockchain in favor of transparent logs, threshold signatures, and distributed hash tables (DHT), FORTIS 3.0 achieves 95\% cost reduction, 100x performance improvement, and unlimited scalability while maintaining cryptographic security and verifiable transparency. The architecture introduces a new paradigm called "Transparent Computing" that mathematically guarantees transparency without the complexity and costs of distributed consensus mechanisms.},
